"Multi-track fusion music generation: Music Information retrieval is one of the polarizing areas in the realm of AI today. Ever imagined if AI can generate coherent
and pleasant music based on the genres one likes? Is AI smart enough to create remix renditions of two different genres good
enough to replace DJs? We will explore a lot of these questions in this project.

A lot of sequence to sequence based models have been explored for quite while now for single track music generation. But bringing in multiple instruments together and generating a multi-track music composition is challenging and requires a mechanism that maintains the coherence while generating music. We aim to explore models that are able to coherently fuse two  different genres and create pleasant music."
